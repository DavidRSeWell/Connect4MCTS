# Connect4MCTS

This repository is an implementation of MCTS on the game of connect 4 using the kaggle connectx environment. It also has a 
supervised learning portion where I trained a Neural network on a database of board position from the UCI Connect4 database
and used the network to guide the search policy. 

A project writeup is included that talks about the intention and experiments of the project.
